## Description

The Remote Support Access Node (RSAN) will allow Puppet support engineers to conduct live troubleshooting, resolving problems more quickly and efficiently and lead to a reduction of system disruption to the customer.  
Customers currently must deliver large volumes of data to support and resolution time is hindered by transfer logistics and privacy concerns. This same data must then be processed by internal support engineers leading to artificially decreased capacity of the support team.

The RSAN platform is designed to be a contained infrastructure endpoint in the customer Puppet Enterprise environment, collating data and access, useful in incident resolution for the target customer deployment.
The node will allow for read-only access to Puppet Entperise Component Data and configiration, and limit other access through Puppet Enterpriseâ€™s built-in Role Based Access Control(RBAC).
The Node has the functionality to make session-based outward connections towards the Puppet Support Network, controllable by the customer user in duration.


## Setup

### What rsan affects 

RSAN will Export NFS mounts of key directories from each infastruture node, while also setting up requirements for gathering of metrics and Database access for the RSAN node.
Software required for the proper functioning of the RSAN will be deployed on the target agent node.

### Beginning with rsan

RSAN has two main classes for use in the installation:

 - rsan::exporter - to be applied to all Puppet infrastructure agents - Console node group "PE Infrastructure Agent"
 - rsan::importer - to be applied to a single node which will be come the Remote Support Access Node(RSAN)

Following the application of these clases to the infrastructure Puppet Will need to be run on the corresponding agents in the following order:

Infrastructure Agent(s)->RSAN Agent->Infrastrcture Agent(s)->RSAN Agent

## Usage
The following outlines the main features of RSAN and how to consume them
### Live Telemetry Display

The Rsan node will host an instance of the [Puppet Metrics Dashboard](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_dashboard)
 
The Dashboard can be accessed on

<RSAN-ip\>:3000\
User: admin\
Password: admin

For advanced configuration and documentation please see [Puppet Metrics Dashboard](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_dashboard)

### Infrastructure node file and log access	

The RSAN node will, by default, mount /var/log/ /opt/puppetlabs and /etc/puppetlabs from each of the Puppet Enterprise Infrastructure nodes on the RSAN platform in the following location, as read only file systems.

/var/pesupport/<FQDN of Infrastructure node\>/var/log\
/var/pesupport/<FQDN of Infrastructure node\>/opt/puppetlabs\
/var/pesupport/<FQDN of Infrastructure node\>/etc/puppetlabs



### PE Client tools

The RSAN node will deploy Puppet Client tools for use by Puppet Enterprise 


### Puppet Enterprise Database Access	

## Uninstallation 

## Limitations
 - The RSAN importer class should only be applied one agent node

## Contributions

For feature development + bug reporting:

 - A Git Issue should exist or be created per feature or Bug
 - Repositary should be forked and any changes made by way of PR to the Main Branch
 - PRS should aways reference a git issue
